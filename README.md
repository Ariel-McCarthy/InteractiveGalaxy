# InteractiveGalaxy

Use the arrow keys to move through the galaxy.
Press **j** to zoom in and **k** to zoom out.
**Move the mouse side to side** to rotate view left and right.
Click **q** to view upward and **e** to view downward.
**w a s d** and the **spacebar** do some cool things, too. 

But, I don't want to spoil everything, so I'll leave you to it. Simply run the .sln file to test drive!
